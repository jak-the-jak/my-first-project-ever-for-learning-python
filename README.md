I'm learning python myself currently. This is my first real project on python!!!

As i completed it, im going to start a new project which i will also add here and make it public.

Since it's my first time using GitHub too, the README file will be dry. But no worries, i'll get used to it and master both github, python and sql in addition.

Thanks!
